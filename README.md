# companion-module-riedel-smartpanel

Bitfocus Companion module for controlling Riedel Smart Panels via WebSocket.

## Features

### Actions

- **Network Configuration**: Set IP addresses for Media1, Config1, and Media2 interfaces
- **Device Control**: Reboot device, fetch device info
- **Health & Alarms**: Monitor health status, active alarms, and alarm history
- **PTP (Precision Time Protocol)**: View and configure PTP settings (domain, hybrid mode, receiver-only mode)
- **Control Panel**: Enable/disable/toggle the Control Panel Application (intercom functionality)
- **NMOS**: Enable/disable/toggle NMOS functionality
- **Identify**: Enable/disable/toggle the panel's identify LEDs, or flash them a specific number of times (locate the physical panel)
- **Identify (Custom IP)**: Same enable/disable/flash actions, but targeting an IP given per action call (supports Companion variables) instead of this connection's configured panel - see [Targeting Multiple Panels](#targeting-multiple-panels-without-a-dedicated-connection) below

- **Mute on any shift page (via Artist/RRCS)**: the actions above reach only the page the panel is currently displaying. **Toggle Key Mute on ANY Page** goes via the Artist system instead and can mute a key on a page nobody is looking at - see [Muting other shift pages](#muting-other-shift-pages) below

### Feedbacks

- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator for WebSocket connection state
- **Health Status**: Color-coded health indicator (OK/Warnings/Errors)
- **Alarm Count**: Threshold-based alarm monitoring with customizable colors
- **PTP Status**: PTP synchronization status (Locked/Unlocked)
- **Control Panel Enabled**: Shows if Control Panel app is active
- **NMOS Enabled**: Shows if NMOS is active
- **Identify Enabled**: Shows if the panel's identify LEDs are active

## Configuration

| Setting          | Description                   | Default |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| Panel IP Address | IP address of the Smart Panel | -       |
| WebSocket Port   | WebSocket port (usually 80)   | 80      |

## Network Interfaces

The Smart Panel has three network interfaces:

- **Media1**: Primary media network interface
- **Config1**: Configuration interface
- **Media2**: Secondary media interface

See also [companion/HELP.md](./companion/HELP.md) for full action and feedback details.

## Muting other shift pages

The panel's own API only ever exposes the shift page it is currently displaying - both for reading mute state (which is decoded from the rendered key images) and for pressing keys. A key on another page cannot be reached that way at all.

The **Artist / RRCS** section of the connection config unlocks a second route. RRCS addresses keys as `Node . Port . Page . ExpansionPanel . KeyNumber`, so page is just a parameter:

- **Toggle Key Mute on ANY Page (via Artist/RRCS - blind toggle)**

**It is a blind toggle by necessity.** Artist provides no way to read per-key mute state, so the action cannot compare against anything - it flips whatever the key currently is. This is why it is named and described separately from the state-aware panel actions rather than folded into them:

| | Set Key Mute (state-aware) | Toggle Key Mute on ANY Page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Route | the panel, directly | Artist (RRCS) |
| Reaches | displayed page only | **any page, any expansion panel** |
| Reads state first | **yes** - only actuates when it differs | no |
| Safe to repeat | **yes**, idempotent | no, each press flips it |

Prefer the state-aware action whenever the key is on the displayed page.

### Configuration

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| RRCS Host | Artist gateway running RRCS. Leave blank to disable the feature |
| RRCS Port | usually `8193` |
| Artist Node / Artist Port | **leave at 0** and let the module discover them |

**Node/Port are discovered automatically.** Set the RRCS host, leave both addresses at `0`, and on the next connect the module looks the panel up in Artist **by name** and saves what it finds into the connection - so it happens once, not on every restart. This needs _Monitor key presses_ enabled, because that is how the panel reports its own name.

The panel's Artist name must match the name the panel reports for itself. If it does not, the log says so; rename it in Director or fill the addresses in by hand.

Re-run the lookup with the **Discover Artist Address (RRCS)** action after renaming or re-patching a panel. It downloads the full Artist port list (several MB on a large system) and takes a few seconds, which is exactly why it is a one-off rather than something done at startup.

## Targeting Multiple Panels Without a Dedicated Connection

Every action in this module except the `*IdentifyAtIp` ones runs against the single panel
configured on the Companion connection (`Panel IP Address` in the connection's config) over
a persistent WebSocket - that's what keeps feedbacks, variables, and health/PTP/alarm polling
live for that one device. If you have many panels and only want live status for a few of them,
adding one Companion connection per panel is the correct, intended way to get that (it's how
Companion is designed to model "one device, one connection").

For a narrower case - flashing/locating an arbitrary panel's identify LEDs without wanting a
dedicated persistent connection, live feedbacks, or status polling for every single panel on the
network - use `Enable Identify (Custom IP)`, `Disable Identify (Custom IP)`, or
`Flash Identify (Custom IP)`. These take the target IP as a per-action option instead of the
connection's configured host, so **one Companion connection can flash any panel by IP**. Each
call opens a short-lived WebSocket directly to that IP, sends the identify command(s), and
closes it - it does not touch or depend on the connection's main WebSocket.

The IP field supports Companion variable syntax, so it can be driven dynamically, e.g. from a
custom variable set elsewhere in your Companion configuration:

```
$(internal:custom_target_panel_ip)
```

Trade-off: because there's no persistent connection to an arbitrary IP, there are no live
feedbacks/variables for it - the module can't show you that panel's health, PTP lock, or
connection state without its own dedicated connection. `*IdentifyAtIp` is fire-and-forget by
design.

| `/Identify/FetchStatus` | Get identify LED state |
| `/Identify/Enable` | Turn on identify LEDs |
| `/Identify/Disable` | Turn off identify LEDs |

`/Identify` has no built-in flash-count or duration parameter - it's a bare on/off latch,
and each `Enable`/`Disable` message is itself one visible flash of the panel's key LEDs
(sending `Enable` does not start a sustained blink that `Disable` then stops). The
`flashIdentify` action reproduces a specific flash count by alternating the latch with a
configurable interval between edges.
